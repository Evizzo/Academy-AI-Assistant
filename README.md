# ðŸ“˜ Project Name: **Academy Assistant**

A professional multilingual chatbot tailored for the needs of students and staff at the Academy of Vocational Studies â€“ Å umadija, AranÄ‘elovac department. 
It combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with multi-agent orchestration to deliver highly accurate and context-aware academic support.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

**Academy Assistant** is an intelligent virtual assistant built to support academic information delivery through:

* Accurate and professional Q\&A on exam schedules
* General information about academic processes and departments
* Context-aware multilingual support

The chatbot strictly adheres to communication rules, uses Serbian Latin (ekavian), and leverages a combination of LLMs and semantic search.

## ðŸ§  Features

* **Agent Orchestration**: Automatically classifies user questions into two categories â€” *exam-related* and *general* â€” and routes them to the appropriate agent.

* **Exam Agent**:

  * Specializes in answering only exam-related questions.
  * Uses a fixed, reliable data source from the database.
  * Rejects any questions not strictly related to exam schedules.
  * Always responds in professional tone and Serbian Latin script.
  * Examples it can handle:

    * "Kada je sledeÄ‡i ispit iz predmeta Matematika?"
    * "Koji je datum ispita za Osnove programiranja?"

* **General Info Agent**:

  * Handles all other inquiries about the academy's organization, staff, location, enrollment, programs, and administrative matters.
  * Incorporates retrieved context using vector search to improve response accuracy.

* **Embedding & Vector Search**:

  * Converts documents into vector representations using `paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2`.
  * Uses Pinecone to search relevant context for the general agent.

* **Web Scraping + Chunking Pipeline**:

  * Scrapes raw text from the official department website `https://ar.asss.edu.rs/`.
  * Converts cyrillic text to Latin.
  * Cleans HTML by removing irrelevant sections like navigation, scripts, and styles.
  * Splits content using LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to maintain semantic coherence.
  * Each chunk is vectorized and stored in Pinecone for future retrieval.

* **Short-Term Memory**:

  * Keeps last N messages for continuity and context-awareness.

* **Secure Client Login**:

  * User sessions are authenticated via username/password stored in a MySQL DB.
  * Users can view and manage their past conversations.

* **Streamlit Frontend**:

  * Clean and responsive UI for chatting.
  * Chat history, message styling, and system notifications included.
